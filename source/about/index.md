Avicii Forever.

Waitng For Love
                    --Avicii(Tim Bergling)

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
有志者事竟成，多么美好的世界
And every night has its day, so magical
黑夜过去就是黎明，这里充满神奇
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
如果生活充满爱，世界将不再有阻碍
That can't be defeated
爱可以战胜一切

For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
每一个残暴的君主都能懂得怜悯
In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
每一个失落的灵魂中都有创造奇迹的傲骨
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
每一个梦想家都有无法阻挡的梦想
With something to believe in
有真诚的信仰


Monday left me broken
星期一我被无情地击败
Tuesday I was through with hoping
星期二我就在希望中复活
Wednesday my empty arms were open
星期三我张开双臂
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
星期四等待爱，等待爱的到来
Thank the stars it's Friday
感谢周五的群星璀璨
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
星期六我像疯狂燃烧的野火
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
星期日我将不会去教堂
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
我会等待爱，等待爱
To come around
等待爱的到来


For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
每一个残暴的君主都能懂得怜悯
In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
每一个失落的灵魂中都有创造奇迹的傲骨
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
每一个梦想家都有无法阻挡的梦想
With something to believe in
有真诚的信仰


Monday left me broken
星期一我被无情地击败
Tuesday I was through with hoping
星期二我就在希望中复活
Wednesday my empty arms were open
星期三我张开双臂
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
星期四等待爱，等待爱的到来
Thank the stars it's Friday

I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
星期六我像疯狂燃烧的野火
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
星期日我将不会去教堂
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
我会等待爱的到来，等待爱
To cover on
让我痊愈




付出、坚持、等待、
